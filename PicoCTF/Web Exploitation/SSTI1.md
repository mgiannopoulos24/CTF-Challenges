The author provides a link to a webpage.

After opening it, we see this:

<img width="435" height="134" alt="ssti1_main_webpage" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d91bbc7d-cbdf-4288-9cb2-9a48eaeb5d39" />

&nbsp;

When we enter our text and click "Ok", it is printed on the page.

Since this is a "Server Side Template Injection" ([SSTI](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/what-is-server-side-template-injection/)) challenge, we inject the payload ```{{7*7}}``` to check. 

The server returns ```49```. This means we can execute code.

&nbsp;

Next, we inject the payload ```{{7*'7'}}``` in order to fingerprint the templating engine.

The server returns ```7777777```, which confirms the use of "jinja2" and "python".

&nbsp;

Our next step is to find a way to run the ```ls``` command, but using "python", as i like to think. ([More info](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/how-use-linux-command-in-python-using-system-os/))

By injecting this payload ```{{self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls').read()}}``` we get our output:

&nbsp;

Our final step, is to run the ```cat``` command for the file we want (in this case for "flag"), again, using "python".

Our payload will now be ```{{self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag').read()}}```

When we click "Ok", the flag should be printed and we will have solved the challenge!
